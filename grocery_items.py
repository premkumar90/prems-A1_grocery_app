#Exercise 1
#Python script that stores the prices of 3 grocery items(Here: milk,bread and eggs) and to calculate and print the total cost
price_milk = 4.5  # Price of milk in dollars
price_bread = 2.5 # Price of bread in dollars
price_eggs = 10.0 # Price of eggs in dollars
total_cost = price_milk + price_bread + price_eggs #Total cost of groceries
print(f"Your total is ${total_cost}")

#Exercise 2
#Create a Python script that asks the user for the name of their favourite grocery store, then prints a silly greeting welcoming them to the store.
store_name = input("What is the name of your favourite grocery store? ") # Asking the user to input the store name
print(f"Welcome to {store_name}! We're glad you're here!") # Printing a greeting with the store name

#Exercise 3
#Fixing a buggy code block
#The code below has to be fixed

# The program has an error, find it and fix it
milk = "3"
bread = 2.5
total = float(milk) + bread
print(f"The total cost is: ${total}")
